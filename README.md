# SQL-AND-R-ETL-Project-Electricity-load-data-Wharehousing-and-Advanced time series forecasting 



**Project Goal:**

To build an automated ETL pipeline, perform data analysis, and forecast electricity usage using SQL, R, PostgreSQL, and pgAdmin.

**Key Steps and skills:**

**Data Extraction:**

Source: Identify the source of your electricity load data. This could be a CSV file, a database, or an API.
Extraction Method: Use appropriate tools and techniques to extract the data. For example, use R packages like readr or DBI to read CSV files or connect to databases.
Data Transformation:

**Cleaning:**

Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
Feature Engineering: Create relevant features like time-based features (hour, day, month, year), lagged values, and rolling averages.
Data Integration: If necessary, integrate data from multiple sources.
Data Loading:

**Database Design:** 

Create a suitable database schema in PostgreSQL to store the cleaned and transformed data.
Loading: Use SQL's INSERT INTO or COPY commands to load the data into the database.
Automation: Automate the data loading process using scripting languages like R or Python.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Use SQL queries to explore the data, identify patterns, and gain insights.
Visualize the data using tools like ggplot2 in R or SQL's built-in plotting capabilities.
Calculate summary statistics, analyze trends, and identify anomalies.

**Forecasting**:

Use time series forecasting techniques in R (e.g., ARIMA, EST) to predict future electricity usage.
Consider incorporating external factors like weather data, economic indicators, and historical trends.
Evaluate the accuracy of the forecasts using appropriate metrics.

**Data Visualization:**

Use visualization tools like ggplot2 or plotly in R to create informative visualizations of the data and forecasts.
SQL and R Code Examples:

**Directions**

Either you can use any SQL database and create a database electicityMarket and use the restore file to restore database. Then use the r code to transform clean and perform analysis.

You could also use the sql query file and execute each line inorder to build the database and all dependensies and tables and also needed to create the userWrighter role to acces the database which you will use in r to extract and load the data
